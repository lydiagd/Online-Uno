**Overview**  
Hey all! Here is a breakdown on what the Database contains. If you want to run this in Eclipse, you will need to add the JDBC jar file that we needed for lab 10.

**db_connect.java**  
The equivalent of a Util class that will allow you to do any operations you would need the database for (i.e. you should not need to write code to connect to the database yourself, I wrote it for you!).

**example.java**  
A list of examples for how you can use the functions of db_connect and what exceptions you will need to handle.

**tester.java**  
A list of tests for db_connect.

**uno.sql**  
Runnable SQL file to create the database.
